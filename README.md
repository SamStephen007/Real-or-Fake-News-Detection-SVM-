# Fake News Detector using SVM

This project is a machine learning web application that classifies news content as **Real** or **Fake** using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It uses text data from news articles and leverages TF-IDF for feature extraction.

## Features

- Classifies text-based news as Real or Fake
- SVM model trained using TF-IDF features
- Flask web interface for real-time predictions
- Simple and clean HTML UI

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Ensure you have the following files:
   - `svm_fake_news_model.pkl`
   - `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Model Training

The SVM model was trained on a balanced dataset of real and fake news articles using TF-IDF for feature extraction:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
```

## Example Inputs

**Real:**
> The Senate passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill on Tuesday.

**Fake:**
> BREAKING: Scientists discover banana cures COVID-19!

## Future Improvements

- Use more advanced models like BERT or LSTM
- Add headline + text combination as input
- Provide confidence scores in predictions
- Deploy with Docker or Streamlit
